The corpus is based on the dataset introduced by Pang and Lee (2005) and consists of 11,855 single sentences extracted from movie reviews. It was parsed with the Stanford parser and includes a total of 215,154 unique phrases from those parse trees, each annotated by 3 human judges.",

Generated using the GPT-3 language model, it was created to address the failure of classifiers to detect subtle and implicit hate speech that lacks obvious profanity. The generation process utilizes a demonstration-based prompting framework and a novel adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method (ALICE) to create challenging examples that can fool existing toxicity detectors. Human evaluations confirm that 94.5% of the generated toxic examples are considered hate speech and 90.5% of the overall data is stylistically indistinguishable from human-written text.",
